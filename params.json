Content is everything.\r\n\r\nThis is the base repository for one|content for Joomla 3.x. \r\n\r\n    .\r\n        build/  contains the phing build script and tooling\r\n        src/    contains the source for the various parts of one|content\r\n        doc/    contains something akin to documentation \r\n\r\n# Building one|content\r\n\r\nCurrently, you will need phing to build the extensions needed to install one|content in Joomla 3.x. Run \r\n\r\n    $ phing\r\n    \r\nto get a list of targets you can build. \r\n\r\n# Installing one|content\r\n\r\n## Easy\r\n\r\nUse the **pkg_one.zip** installer package. It's not working yet, but when it is finished, life will be easier.\r\n\r\n## Harder\r\n\r\nYou will need to build and install the following parts:\r\n\r\n* the system plugin (target: **plg_one**) which sets up the autoloader for one|content\r\n* the **core** and **joomla** extensions, containing the standard library\r\n* the **script** extension containing what was formerly known as *nanoscript* which is now integral part of one|content \r\n* the **com_one** component, for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n# Version\r\n\r\nThe current version is called **predawn** which kind of gives you a hint where we are with one|content. Below is a short summary of where each part is at in its development cycle.\r\n\r\n**I'm warning you formally that there will be significant changes to class names, file structures etc. before we have the official first GA release.** \r\n\r\n## plg_one\r\n\r\nSystem plugin needs better parameter config but basically does what it needs to do. \r\n\r\n## libraries aka. one|content extensions\r\n\r\nMost of one|content's stuff is stored in `/libraries/one/lib`. The principal library is **core** and it contains the one|content framework itself. The **joomla** extension contains whatever is joomla-specific. The **script** extension contains the default templater, but I've already tested a PHP-ony templater as an alternative, but not thoroughly.  \r\n\r\nThe code for these is refactored from the previous J2.x version of one|content and heavily work in progress. I assume that most of the short-term changes are going to be located here. To give you an idea, any file named `whatever_tbd.php` has not been fully sanitized -- which does not by any standard mean that 'regular' files are completely sanitized.\r\n  \r\nYou will also find other src/extension folders containing unmigrated material.\r\n\r\n## demo\r\n\r\nThis is a fun extension I am working on, intended to provide a standard set of one|content material as an introduction. It will use mainly the standard Joomla database tables.  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
