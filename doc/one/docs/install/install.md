# Installing one|content

## Easy

Use the **pkg_one.zip** installer package. It's not working yet, but when it is finished, life will be easier.

## Harder

You will need to build and install the following parts:

* the system plugin (target: **plg_one**) which sets up the autoloader for one|content
* the **core** and **joomla** extensions, containing the standard library
* the **script** extension containing what was formerly known as *nanoscript* which is now integral part of one|content 
* the **com_one** component, for obvious reasons.
