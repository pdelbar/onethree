# A true story

At one of the first @oc bootcamps, I asked participants to describe the last projects they had been working on and list the semantic entities they were using. One of the described his attempts to build his company's new project portfolio. As he was explaining what he wanted the site to do, I wrote the data structure on the flipchart, looking something like this:

```
   CUSTOMER  ----1:many---- PROJECT ----many:many---- TECHNOLOGY
                               |
                           many:many
                               |
                            PARTNER
```

He admitted that he had been working on this for a week or two, but had not quite finished it all. Remember, CCKs had not been invented at that time. 

I sat down at the computer and started describing data types and relations. I created a few tables, added a few lines of data, created a menu item and coded a first @oc view. We had the list of projects up in under 15 minutes. When the hour was over, we had a working minisite, requiring nothing more than a designer's hand to make it look pretty (Bootstrap did not exist either). 
  
That was the very fist time I realized we had built something really nice. Good enough to make a grown man swear, bordering on crying.
